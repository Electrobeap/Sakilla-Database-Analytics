Project Features:

	•	Database Overview: The Sakila database consists of several tables including:
	•	Actors, Films, and Categories: Representing movie inventory details.
	•	Customers and Staff: Tracking customer information and employee roles.
	•	Rentals, Payments, and Inventory: Handling rental transactions, payments, and available stock.
	•	Python Integration: Data from the database is analyzed using Python libraries such as:
	•	Pandas: For data manipulation and querying.
	•	Matplotlib and Seaborn: For generating visual insights (bar charts, pie charts, histograms, etc.).
	•	SQLAlchemy: For database connection and querying.
	•	Key Analysis and Visualizations:
	•	Rental activity trends: Analysis of rental frequency, popular rental times, and customer demographics.
	•	Revenue breakdown: Insights into revenue generation by film category, rental duration, and location.
	•	Customer behavior: Identifying frequent customers and preferences based on rental history.
	•	Inventory management: Analysis of stock levels, most rented films, and category popularity.

Technologies Used:

	•	Python using Google Collaboratory: For data analysis and visualization.
	•	SQLAlchemy: For database interaction.
	•	Google Collaboratory Notebook: For documenting and presenting analysis.

This project showcases the integration of SQL databases with Python for business intelligence and data-driven decision-making.

You can tailor this further based on specific details of your implementation.
